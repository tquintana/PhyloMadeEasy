			<p>Phylo-Made-Easy is a web application that is designed to help you understand the intricacies behind the
			construction of a phylogenetic tree, utilizing functions and methods used by bioinformaticians in both the lab and industry. But
			what exactly is a phylogenetic tree?</p>
			<p>A phylogenetic tree is a representation of the evolutionary relationships between a set of organisms.
			However, the relationships described by a phylogenetic tree are only estimations based on the information at hand, and are by
			no means definitive of the evolution which occurred between the organisms of interest. Not only can phylogenetic trees show the connections
			among organisms, but also among genes or sequences, such as mRNA, DNA, or protein sequences. The focus of this application will be
			on biological sequences.</p>
			<p>Bioinformaticians are often asked to create phylogenetic trees from sequences for those who study evolutionary biology.
			But how does one create a phylogenetic tree?</p>
			<p>First, the relationship between the given sequences must be estimated through a multiple sequence alignment.
			It is from this alignment that a distance matrix can be created to determine the evolutionary, or genetic, distance between each of the sequences.
			A tree representation can then be created through referencing both the alignment and the distance matrix. Such actions can be performed on the tree
			to help to validate the relationships which were estimated.</p>
			<p>A "Terms and Equations" page is provided to supply the definitions for common bioinformatics vocabulary. Please
			refer to this page whenever you come across a word which you you do not understand, as it will provide information in the context of this
			application.</p> <br>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>Some parts of this application assume you know how to program in Python. <br>
